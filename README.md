# Modern Data Lab
#### Create a modern data infrastructure.

The goal of this series of labs is to provide practical, hands-on experience with the modern data ecosystem to prepare you to work effectively in an enterprise team. Working effectively in a team involves more than just knowing the essentials of Hadoop or Cassandra, although those skills are mandatory. You will also need to be familiar with working in a modern enterprise development environment.

## Prerequisites
### Source Control
We will be using git for source control and the GitHub Flow process in this tutorial.

#### GitHub
I recommend going through the [GitHub On-Demand training](https://services.github.com/on-demand/intro-to-github/ "GitHub 101") for a thorough grounding in GitHub.

You will need to perform the following:
 - [create a github account](https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/ "Create a github account")
 - [navigate to the course repo](https://github.com/2cData/modern_data_lab "Course repo")
 - [fork the course repo to your repo ](https://guides.github.com/activities/forking/ "Fork a repo")

#### Git
I recommend going through the [Git from the CLI training](https://services.github.com/on-demand/github-cli/ "Git CLI") to understand how to work with git and github from the command line.

 - [install git locally](https://help.github.com/articles/set-up-git/ "Install Git locally")
 - [clone your repo](https://services.github.com/on-demand/github-cli/clone-repo-cli "Clone your repo")

### Container Management
#### Docker
 - [setup Docker locally](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/ "Get Started with Docker")
 - [create Docker Hub account](https://docs.docker.com/docker-id/ "Create Docker ID")

### Cloud Services
#### Amazon Web Services
You will need a credit or debit card to setup an AWS account. We will only use the free tier for this class.

 - [create an AWS account](https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/create-and-activate-aws-account/ "Create AWS account")
 - [launch and destroy a virtual machine](https://aws.amazon.com/getting-started/tutorials/launch-a-virtual-machine/?trk=gs_card "Create a machine instance")
