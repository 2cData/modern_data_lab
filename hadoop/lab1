# Download Hadoop
$ wget http://www-us.apache.org/dist/hadoop/common/hadoop-3.1.1/hadoop-3.1.1.tar.gz

# Uncompress Hadoop tarball
$ tar zxvf hadoop-3.1.1.tar.gz
$ rm hadoop-3.1.1.tar.gz

# Create a symbolic link to the uncompressed directory to make upgrades easier on scripts
$ ln -s /usr/hadoop-3.1.1 /usr/hadoop

# Check to see if Hadoop is installed and functioning
$ cd /usr/hadoop
$ bin/hadoop version
# You should see Hadoop 3.1.1
```

After executing `bin\hadoop` you should have
