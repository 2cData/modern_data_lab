# Lab One - Minimum Viable Hadoop
The goal is to set up a single node Hadoop cluster on your local machines manually.

## Step one - create docker image
The preferred method for doing new things that may not work out well is to do it a container. This has two great advantages: you can't trash your machine and you can send the image to someone else once it works and it will definitely work on their machine.

We will create a Centos image with Java 8 to form a base for all of our future modern data work. For the most part, you will be deploying to Red Hat Enterprise Linux in Production. Using Centos in Dev and Stage is a low cost way to make sure that your environments are consistent across the development lifecycle. This is Factor X in a [12 Factor App](https://12factor.net/ "12 Factor App"). At the time of this writing Java 9 was out but Java 8 was the minimum required for most modern data platforms and likely all you will get at most enterprises.

From a terminal, run
```
docker pull centos
docker run -i -t centos
cd ~
yum install wget
wget --no-cookies --no-check-certificate --header "Cookie: gpw_e24=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.oracle.com%2F; oraclelicense=accept-securebackup-cookie" "http://download.oracle.com/otn-pub/java/jdk/8u181-b13/96a7b8442fe848ef90c96a2fad6ed6d1/jdk-8u181-linux-x64.rpm"
yum localinstall jdk-8u181-linux-x64.rpm
echo "export JAVA_HOME=/usr/java/default/" > /etc/profile.d/java_home.sh
rm ~/jdk-8u181-linux-x64.rpm
java -version
echo $JAVA_HOME
```
You (should) now have a running container that have Centos running ```java version "1.8.0_131``` with a JAVA_HOME environment variable pointed to ```/usr/java/default```.
